## Hi there 👋

- 👨‍💻 I’m currently working on Co-GAN.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VLSI CAD and Apple software development.
- 🙋‍♂️ I’m looking to collaborate on software backend and UI design, hoping to make friends with software engineer, IC engineer and UI deisgner.
- 🔭 I hope I can make some contribution to the development of human science and technology, and make several small software to facilitate human life.
